    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with\n",
    "an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF) is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It maps the probability of each possible outcome of the random variable. For example, consider a fair six-sided dice. The PMF for rolling the dice can be given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "X\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\n",
    "P(X=x)\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF) is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike the PMF, it doesn't give the exact probability of a specific value but gives the probability density of the random variable at each point. For example, consider the probability distribution of the height of adult females in a population. The PDF can be a normal distribution with mean 65 inches and standard deviation 3 inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is used to describe the cumulative probability distribution of a random variable. It gives the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to a particular value. For example, consider the CDF for the fair six-sided dice from the previous example.\n",
    "\n",
    "X\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\n",
    "P(X<=x)\t1/6\t2/6\t3/6\t4/6\t5/6\t1\n",
    "CDF is used to find the probability of a random variable being less than or equal to a particular value or in a range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model?\n",
    "Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal distribution can be used as a model in situations where the data is approximately symmetric and bell-shaped. It is commonly used in areas such as finance, quality control, and social sciences. For example, the heights and weights of individuals in a population often follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution has two parameters: mean and standard deviation. The mean determines the center of the distribution, and the standard deviation determines the spread of the distribution. The normal distribution is symmetrical around the mean, with 68% of the data within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal\n",
    "Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is important because it is widely used to model many natural phenomena and is a fundamental concept in statistics. Many statistical tests and methods rely on the assumption that the data is normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some real-life examples of the normal distribution include:\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of heights and weights of individuals in a population.\n",
    "The distribution of IQ scores in a population.\n",
    "The distribution of test scores in a classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: What is Bernaulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli\n",
    "Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the probability of a single trial with two possible outcomes, usually labeled as success (1) or failure (0). For example, tossing a coin where the outcome is either heads (success) or tails (failure) can be modeled using the Bernoulli distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution is that the Bernoulli Distribution models the probability of a single trial, while the Binomial Distribution models the probability of a certain number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset\n",
    "is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater\n",
    "than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    ": To calculate the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60 in a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10, we need to calculate the z-score and then use a standard normal distribution table or calculator. The z-score formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "where x is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean of the distribution, and σ is the standard deviation. Substituting the given values, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (60 - 50) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the probability of getting a z-score of 1 or greater is approximately 0.1587. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60 is 0.1587 or about 15.87%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Explain uniform Distribution with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uniform distribution is a probability distribution where all values between a minimum and maximum value are equally likely to occur. The probability density function of a uniform distribution is a constant between the minimum and maximum values and zero elsewhere. A typical example of a uniform distribution is rolling a fair die, where each number has an equal probability of appearing. Another example is choosing a random number between 0 and 1, where any value in that range is equally likely to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: What is the z score? State the importance of the z score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a distribution. It is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "where x is the data point, μ is the mean of the distribution, and σ is the standard deviation. The z-score allows us to standardize data across different normal distributions, making it easier to compare and analyze data.\n",
    "Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the sampling distribution of the means of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. In other words, if we take many samples of the same size from any population, the distribution of the sample means will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases.\n",
    "Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Sampling: The samples must be drawn randomly from the population.\n",
    "Independence: The samples must be independent of each other.\n",
    "Sample Size: The sample size should be large enough (typically, n > 30).\n",
    "Population Distribution: The population distribution should not be extremely skewed or have extreme outliers.\n"
