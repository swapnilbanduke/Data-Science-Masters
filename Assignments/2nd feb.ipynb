    "\n",
    "1) Order: Tuples maintain the order of elements and allow duplicate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Immutability: Tuples are immutable, which means once created, their elements cannot be changed or modified.\n",

    "3) Heterogeneity: Tuples can contain elements of different data types.\n",

    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The union and update methods are both used to add elements to a set, but they work in slightly different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) union: The union method returns a new set that is the union of the original set and another set, list, or any other iterable. The original set is not modified. If the elements being added already exist in the original set, they are not added again, as sets do not allow duplicate elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "print(union_set)\n",
    "#Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "2)update: The update method adds all the elements from another set, list, or any other iterable to the original set. The original set is modified in place and no new set is returned. If the elements being added already exist in the set, they are not added again, as sets do not allow duplicate elements.\n",
    "\n",

    "print(set1)\n",

    "**Q5. What is a dictionary? Give an example. Also, state whether a dictionary is ordered or unordered.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Dictionaries are commonly used to store and retrieve data efficiently, as they allow you to access values based on their associated keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 32, 'address': '123 Main St'}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the keys 'name', 'age', and 'address' are associated with the values 'John', 32, and '123 Main St', respectively. You can access the values using square brackets ([]) and the keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that dictionaries in Python are unordered. This means that the keys and values in a dictionary are not stored in any particular order, and the order may change as you add or remove elements from the dictionary. If we need to maintain the order of elements in a collection, we can use a list or a tuple instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Can we create a nested dictionary? If so, please give an example by creating a simple one-level\n",
    "nested dictionary.\n",
