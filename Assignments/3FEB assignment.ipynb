    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator function is a special type of function in Python that returns a generator object. A generator object is an iterable that produces a sequence of values using the yield statement. The yield statement is used to generate values one at a time on demand, without generating all of the values up front. This allows the generator to produce an arbitrarily large number of values without using an excessive amount of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield keyword is used in a generator function to produce a value and pause execution of the function, while retaining its local state. The function can be resumed later, picking up right where it left off, and producing the next value. This allows a generator function to produce values on demand, one at a time, instead of generating all of the values up front.\n",
